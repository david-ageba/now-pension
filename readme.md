This repository was created to keep track of all our internal automation solutions.

=========================
[     Generic rules     ]
=========================

1. There is no commit allowed on master branch. That is only for checkout purposes.
2. Commits will be merged periodically (weekly) to the master branch.
3. To check out a specific project, use the specific branch out of the following:
	- csharp-cathay
	- csharp-empty
	- java-loyalty
	- ruby-GHI_TT
	- ruby-TLS
4. If you want to add a project to the repository, create a new branch, and then merge it to master.
5. If in doubt about something, ask questions first.
6. Commit and push your modifications only after you have checked that you are on the correct branch, 
   your tests are perfectly working (meaning, there are no build errors, not that you have 100% success rate)

That's all folks! Happy coding! ;) Peace, out!
